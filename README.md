The word "knoTodo" combines knot and todo.
The Former is a symbol of the connection between today and tomorrow.

The unique aspect of this application is that it makes keep your eyes on today under "zen" philosophy.
In this theory, one has to live on today, because there is nothing but the day in his hands.
However, our minds tend to ceaselessly chase after tomorrow, or run away to yesterday.
